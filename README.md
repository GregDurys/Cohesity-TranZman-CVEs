# Cohesity TranZman Security Advisories

This repository contains security advisories for vulnerabilities discovered in
Cohesity TranZman Migration Appliance (formerly Stone Ram TranZman).

## Summary

During an authorised security assessment in September 2025, five vulnerabilities
were identified in TranZman Release 4.0 Build 14614. These vulnerabilities allow
authenticated administrators to escape the intended restricted shell environment,
escalate privileges to root, execute arbitrary code, and recover stored credentials
through weak cryptographic protections.

## About TranZman

TranZman is a migration appliance developed by Stone Ram Limited (acquired by
Cohesity in October 2025) used to facilitate migrations between NetBackup
domains. It is deployed as a virtual appliance (OVA) and is intended as a
temporary solution used solely for the duration of the migration process.

Core components include:

- Web application for administration
- CLISH restricted shell for SSH access
- FTP daemon for file transfers
- Message queue service
- TZM Recorder utility for NetBackup environment assessment
